Tourism is not only an important aspect of a country\u2019s economy but also for its global standing.\n\n###### How come Tourism plays a pivotal role to any country?  \nThe tourism industry is important for the benefits it brings and due to its role as a commercial activity that creates demand and growth for many more industries. Tourism not only contributes to more economic activities but also generates more employment, revenues, and play a significant role in development.\n- Tourism activity creates demand.\n- Tourism induces more consumption.\n- Tourism industry value chain meets & spreads demand across industries & boosts more economic activities.\n"

Then we use Python\u2019s geopy package to obtain the latitude and longitude of all the districts present in the dataframe.  \n\n###### Description of the data\nThe output shows the final dataset . The dataset consists of a single Dataframe with 9 columns containing state, districts, latitude and longitudes of the particular district etc. Other columns like code, headquarters, population, area and density have also been scraped from the website which can be used for further analysis.\n"
